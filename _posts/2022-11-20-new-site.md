<!--desc.start-->
New website released! My old one looked *terrible* - so this time, I made sure to make the website
with design in mind. This one is based off of the [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io),
and looks *much* better!
<!--desc.end-->

Fun fact: This website has **no JavaScript**. 0. Nil. Nada. Not even any cheating with WebAssembly,
nor TypeScript, nor any other off-brand JavaScript language. It's pure HTML and CSS.

Ok, maybe I cheated a *little* by using Jekyll's built-in [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)
interpreter. But that's still a compile-time language, and turns into regular HTML.

Don't believe me? Get [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and
disable JavaScript on this website. Everything will behave as normal.

# Changes...
Here's the worst changelog in history™:
- This site is now hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), running with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It was previously on [Replit](https://repl.it). This should mean more uptime for the site!
- Its design (attempts to) follow Google's [Material 3 Design Guidelines](https://m3.material.io).
(Previously was... uh...)
- There's no JavaScript in the site anymore (flex)
